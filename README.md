# eXit - A Terminal-based Game Recreation from *Mr. Robot*

Welcome to **eXit**, a fan recreation of the terminal-based game featured in *Mr. Robot* (S4E11). This project is built using [Go](https://golang.org) and the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework. 

Not only does this game stay true to the original look and feel from the show, but it also includes hidden **easter eggs** that fans of *Mr. Robot* will appreciate. Additionally, I've utilized [Ansify](https://github.com/ZachLTech/Ansify), one of my other projects, to convert key scenes from *Mr. Robot* into terminal-friendly ANSI images, creating an immersive and authentic gameplay environment.

To play this game yourself, simply run `ssh -p 24 zachl.tech` in your terminal.

## 🚀 Features

- **Classic Terminal-based Gameplay**: Experience the eerie and nostalgic feeling of playing *eXit* just like in the show.
- **Hidden Easter Eggs**: Discover references to iconic scenes and moments from *Mr. Robot* as you play.
- **ANSI Art Integration**: Utilizes [Ansify](https://github.com/ZachLTech/Ansify) to bring scenes from *Mr. Robot* to life in the terminal with ANSI images.
- **Terminal Animations**: Smooth terminal animations enhance the gaming experience.
- **Future Terminal Game Engine**: This project will serve as a foundation for a fully-fledged terminal-based game engine in the future.
- **SSH Support Coming Soon**: Play the game over SSH with Docker integration for a seamless, accessible experience.

## 🎨 ANSI Art & Animations

This project integrates with [Ansify](https://github.com/ZachLTech/Ansify) to convert scenes from *Mr. Robot* into terminal-friendly ANSI images. As you progress through the game, you’ll encounter animations and visuals that bring the *Mr. Robot* universe directly into your terminal.

### Creating Your Own ANSI Art

If you'd like to customize the game’s scenes or add your own, you can use [Ansify](https://github.com/ZachLTech/Ansify) to convert images into ANSI format, ensuring they are compatible with the terminal interface.

## 🖥️ SSH Access

Run `ssh -p 24 zachl.tech` in your terminal to play eXit!

## 🌌 Future Plans

- **Terminal Game Engine**: I'm working towards developing a full-featured terminal-based game engine based on the mechanics and aesthetics of *eXit*. This engine will support animations, ANSI art, and complex game mechanics—all within a terminal environment.
- **More Easter Eggs**: Expect additional hidden features and references for *Mr. Robot* enthusiasts... and maybe this will be a key to the puzzle for my CTF/Treasure Hunt (Coming Soon...)
